                 <p>Over 40 years ago, when doctors relied on stethoscope and pulse as their primary investigation tools, one man set up a diagnostic laboratory believing that the future of investigative medicine will rely upon laboratory tests as a primary diagnostic tool. Today, this laboratory has grown to incorporate the latest in diagnostic medicine, supporting clinicians across the region with reliable reports for accurate diagnosis and treatment of illnesses.</p>
